# Console3D
A "3D" renderer made by following OneLoneCoder's tutorial.

Check out the window size variables in ConsoleDoom.cpp and make sure to set your command prompt buffer size to them at runtime (right click -> properties -> layout).

Changing the sizes in the file itself is possible up to a certain number (a monitor-specific character limit imposed by the CMD). After that number, you will get a black screen.
